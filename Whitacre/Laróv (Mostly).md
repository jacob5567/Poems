**"Laróv (Mostly)" by Hila Plitmann**

"Laróv," amár gag la'shama'im,  
"Hamerchák shebeynéynu hu ad;  
Ach lifnéy zman alu lechán shna'im,  
Uveynéynu nishár sentiméter echad"  

"Mostly," said the roof to the sky,  
"the distance between you and I is endlessness;  
But a while ago two came up here,  
And only one centimeter was left between us."
