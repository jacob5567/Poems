**"The Dreamer" by Brad Mehldau**

The dreamer glimpses things he has never  
Seen before, and they will change him forever  
In the world of dreams,  
Things happen that are not possible in the world he came from  
Questions are answered,  
But the answers are in a language he's never heard before.  
He understands that language, though, in the dream  
Everything is resolved in the dream, or so it seems  
But it all must remain in the dream.  
When he awakens, he will forget that language  
It will be incomprehensible again  
He will only remember that when he dreamed, he understood it  
He will forget the music he heard in his dream  
Music that made him fly  
Music that made him escape from his body  
Music that made him escape from time itself  
But he will remember when he awakens  
That there was this music  
That there must be music like this somewhere  
Even if it is only in dreams  
The dreamer experiences everything passively  
He lies asleep and it moves through him  
These experiences may be more  
Wondrous than anything else he's ever tasted  
But they are perpetually out of his grasp  
The dreamer has no power  
He has no will  
The dreams enter through him  
And he is their vessel
