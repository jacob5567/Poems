**"Sleep" by Charles Anthony Silvestri**

The evening hangs beneath the moon,  
A silver thread on darkened dune.  
With closing eyes and resting head  
I know that sleep is coming soon.  

Upon my pillow, safe in bed,  
A thousand pictures fill my head.  
I cannot sleep, my mind's a-flight;  
And yet my limbs seem made of lead.  

If there are noises in the night,  
A frightning shadow, flickering light,  
Then I surrender unto sleep,  
Where clouds of dream give second sight  

What dreams may come, both dark and deep,  
Of flying wings and soaring leap  
As I surrender unto sleep,  
As I surrender unto sleep.
